3. Specific PHP rules:

- No use of "eval" and alike functionality, e.g. the preg_match-e-modifier
- No use of "goto" statement and no labels for it
- No use of echo and other verbose commands unless there is no alternative
- No use of the use statement for imports due to bugs with some PHP handlers
- Short array syntax when defining arrays
- Only one command per line and reduce nesting of commands as good as possible
- No code that is within comments, link to e.g. tasks and tickets instead
- No use of AND and OR because && and || do the same and are more common
- All parts that are unfinished or might need later changes must have a TODO tag
