Naming
------

Filenames:

- All filenames are lowercase to retain compatibility
- Only hyphens, underscores, dots, numbers and letters are allowed

PHP Classes:

- CamelCase for class names, but filenames stay lowercase due to PHP limitations
- CamelCase for method names and functions
- Variable names should describe their usage as good as possible
