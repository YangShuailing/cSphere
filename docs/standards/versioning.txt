Versioning
----------

Regarding version control systems:

1. Only GIT is allowed with the following settings:

- autocrlf = false
- ignorecase = false
- safecrlf = false
- symlinks = false

2. No commits to master branch, only merges on new versions

3. All patches and change proposals must be submitted as a pull request

4. Look at coding rules for further details, e.g. on filenames


Regarding version numbers in general:

1. Follow the Semantic Versioning Standard (http://www.semver.org)

- Version consists of major.minor.patch, e.g. 1.2.3
- API breaks are only allowed for major version changes
- Minor and patch versions must be backwards-compatible
- New features are not allowed for patch versions
