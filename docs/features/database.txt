Database
--------

Currently only PDO based database drivers are available.
While newer versions of database servers work the same or even better
this list of supported database servers contains the lowest working version:

Microsoft SQLSRV 2012
MySQL            5.5
PostgreSQL       9.0
SQLite           3.0

Other drivers might be added if requested as long as they fit common criterias.
Please visit our support website if you have questions regarding this.

There are different possibilities to work with the database:

1. Send queries directly to the Database component
2. Use SQL DML and DDL tools to generate most common CRUD commands
3. Use the Datamapper component which abstracts the above solutions (recommended)

Since parameter binding is forced there is no need for escaping usual values.
All database actions use prepared statements if supported by driver.
Only the persistence layer is handled and abstracted by the Datamapper.
If you need results cached between requests use e.g. the Cache component.
Serial type for a column means that it is an integer with auto increment applied

For details on how to work with the database view the datamapper documentation.
